# Homework 8
For assignment 8, we created our own multi-table, relational database to build an MVC web application that resembled a live-bidding auction website.

## Link to YouTube Demonstration
Video shows following site functions:
1. Home page showing recent bids ordered by timestamp
2. View list of all items 
3. Create page - add two items 
4. Edit page - edit one of the added items
5. Delete page - delete one of the added items 
6. Item details page - item info and bids (if any)
7. Bid on item and have page refreshed to show new bid
8. Bid on item in separate window to show live-bid functionality on details page
